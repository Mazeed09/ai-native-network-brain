# AI-Native Network Brain

An AI-driven system that observes network metrics, reasons about system health, and suggests interventions using LLM reasoning.

## Project Structure

- `network_sim.py`: Generates synthetic network data
- `state_analysis.py`: Classifies network state
- `ai_brain/reasoning.py`: Uses an LLM to interpret network state and suggest actions

## Goals

- Demonstrate AI reasoning on real-like systems
- Showcase systems-level understanding
- Build a portfolio piece for OpenAI Residency 2026
